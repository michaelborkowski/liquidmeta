To try Circular Judgments

  [ ] need to defer contents of WellFormedness.v into Typing.v

  [ ] Rename BasicPropsWellFormedness.v -> BasicPropsWFFT.v 

  [ ] move stuff in BasicPropsWFFT.v related to WFtype/WFEnv 
	into BasicPropsWellFormedness.v *after* Typing.v

  [ ] move LemmasWeakenWF.v into LemmasWeakenTyp.v for mutually recursion

  [ ] move LemmasWeakenWFTV.v into LemmasWeakenTypTV.v (mut. recursion)

  [ ] Weakening immediately after Typing and BasicPropsWellFormedness
