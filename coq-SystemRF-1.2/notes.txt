To try Circular Judgments

  [X] need to defer contents of WellFormedness.v into Typing.v

  [X] Rename BasicPropsWellFormedness.v -> BasicPropsWFFT.v 

  [X] move stuff in BasicPropsWFFT.v related to WFtype/WFEnv 
	into BasicPropsWellFormedness.v *after* Typing.v

  [ ] move free_subset and wftype_islct back to LemmasTyping.v

  [X] move LemmasWeakenWF.v into LemmasWeakenTyp.v for mutually recursion

  [ ] move LemmasWeakenWFTV.v into LemmasWeakenTypTV.v (mut. recursion)

  [ ] Weakening immediately after Typing and BasicPropsWellFormedness

  [ ] LemmasWellFormedness.v then PrimitivesWFType.v after Weakening

  [ ] Here we can do a subtyping file with
	* lem_sub_refl				Sub
	* lem_subtype_in_exists			Sub
	* lem_self_idempotent_upper		Exact
	* all of LemmasExactnessSubsst		ExactSubst

  [ ] Possibly need to do tiny helper lemmas from LemmasTyping

  [ ] Next combine SubstitutionLemmaWFTV/TypTV into one module
	- no but this needs LemmasSubt, LemmasExact, LemmasExactSubst

  [ ] Then do the rest of LemmasTyping, LemmasSubtyping, LemmasExactness

  [ ] Then do SubstitutionLemmaWF/Typ as one file
