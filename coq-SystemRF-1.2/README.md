# coq-SystemRF

Change log

v1.1 - add If statements, Errors. Up to date with Coq 8.16

The software requirements to run this artifact (compile with `GHC` and check with `LiquidHaskell`) are:
  - a recent version of Coq (we tested on Coq version 8.15.1)

To build and check the mechanization, run the `configure` script to build a makefile:

```
./configure
make
```

Checking the mechanization should take 30 seconds to a minute or two, depending on your system.
